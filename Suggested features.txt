Here are several suggested features we could add to enhance the SDK:

Caching Layer
python
CopyInsert
class SefariaCache:
    def __init__(self, ttl: int = 3600):  # 1 hour default TTL
        self.cache = {}
        self.ttl = ttl
This would cache API responses to reduce API calls and improve performance, especially for frequently accessed texts.

Async Support
python
CopyInsert
class AsyncSefariaClient:
    async def get_text(self, tref: str, **kwargs):
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(f"{self.base_url}/v3/texts/{quote(tref)}", params=kwargs) as response:
                return await response.json()
This would allow for non-blocking API calls, useful in web applications or when making multiple requests.

Text Processing Utilities
python
CopyInsert
class TextProcessor:
    @staticmethod
    def extract_verses(text_data: Dict) -> List[str]:
        """Extract individual verses from text response."""
        
    @staticmethod
    def format_hebrew(text: str) -> str:
        """Format Hebrew text with proper RTL and nikud handling."""
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_parallel_texts(hebrew: str, english: str) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
        """Align Hebrew and English texts verse by verse."""
Error Handling and Retry Logic
python
CopyInsert
class SefariaRetry:
    def __init__(self, max_retries: int = 3, backoff_factor: float = 0.5):
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.backoff_factor = backoff_factor
This would add robust error handling and automatic retries for failed API calls.

Rate Limiting
python
CopyInsert
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, calls: int = 100, period: int = 60):
        self.calls = calls  # calls per period
        self.period = period  # period in seconds
To respect API limits and prevent throttling.

Data Export Features
python
CopyInsert
class DataExporter:
    def to_pdf(self, text_data: Dict, output_path: str):
        """Export text to PDF with proper formatting."""
        
    def to_epub(self, text_data: Dict, output_path: str):
        """Export text to EPUB format."""
        
    def to_csv(self, text_data: Dict, output_path: str):
        """Export text data to CSV format."""
Text Analysis Tools
python
CopyInsert
class TextAnalyzer:
    def find_citations(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
        """Find biblical/rabbinic citations in text."""
        
    def get_word_frequency(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """Analyze word frequency in text."""
        
    def find_similar_passages(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
        """Find similar passages in the Sefaria library."""
CLI Interface
python
CopyInsert
def create_cli():
    """Create a command-line interface for the SDK."""
    import click
    
    @click.command()
    @click.argument('reference')
    @click.option('--language', default='en')
    def get_text(reference, language):
        client = SefariaClient()
        print(client.get_text(reference, version=language))
Streaming Support
python
CopyInsert
class StreamingClient:
    def stream_text(self, tref: str) -> Generator[str, None, None]:
        """Stream text content for large texts."""
        
    def stream_search_results(self, query: str) -> Generator[Dict, None, None]:
        """Stream search results for large result sets."""
Advanced Search Features
python
CopyInsert
class AdvancedSearch:
    def semantic_search(self, query: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search by meaning rather than exact words."""
        
    def fuzzy_search(self, query: str, threshold: float = 0.8) -> List[Dict]:
        """Search with fuzzy matching for spelling variations."""
Validation and Schema
python
CopyInsert
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TextReference(BaseModel):
    book: str
    chapter: int
    verse: Optional[int]
    
    def to_tref(self) -> str:
        """Convert to Sefaria text reference format."""
Integration Helpers
python
CopyInsert
class WebFrameworkIntegration:
    class Flask:
        """Flask-specific integration helpers."""
        
    class Django:
        """Django-specific integration helpers."""
        
    class FastAPI:
        """FastAPI-specific integration helpers."""
Would you like me to implement any of these features? Each one would add significant value to the SDK:

Caching would improve performance
Async support would make it more suitable for web applications
Text processing would help with Hebrew/English text handling
Error handling would make it more robust
Rate limiting would prevent API abuse
Export features would add practical utility
Text analysis would add scholarly research capabilities
CLI would make it accessible from command line
Streaming would handle large texts efficiently
Advanced search would improve text discovery
Validation would make it more type-safe
Framework integration would make it easier to use in web apps
Let me know which features interest you most and I can prioritize implementing them!
