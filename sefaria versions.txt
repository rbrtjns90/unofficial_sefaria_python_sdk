List of fields to aggregate on. Common fields are path for the text type and group or topics for the sheet type

ADD STRING
field
string
The field you want to query. Common fields to query are exact or naive_lemmatizer for the text and merged indices. For querying the sheet index, commonly you'll query the content field
filter_fields
array
Must be the same length as filters. Each entry specifies the field to apply the corresponding filter in filters. For queries of type text this has no effect since there's only one field to filter text queries on (path. this field is explained in filters). For sheet queries, the following fields can appear in filter_fields: collections (corresponds to the collections that the sheet is in), topics_en (corresponds to the topics for this sheet, translated into English), topics_he (corresponds to the topics for this sheet, translated into Hebrew).
filters
array
A list of filters to filter results. These filters cannot include RegEx. Any RegEx characters will be escaped. Each filter is applied to the corresponding field in the filter_fields list. E.g. if filters is ["Passover", "Torah Talks"] and filter_fields is ["topics_en", "collections"] then the "Passover" filter will be applied to the "topics_en" field and the "Torah Talks" filter will be applied to the "collections" field. For text queries, filters always applies to the path field of documents. This essentially corresponds to the category path of the book in Sefaria's table of contents (there are some differences with regards to commentary paths). For sheet queries, filters can be applied to collections, topics_en or topics_he. These fields are explained in filter_fields param.
query
string
Your search query.
size

slop
int32

Common fields to sort on are comp_date (which list results from titles published chronologically), order (which list results based on Sefaria's table of contents structure), pagesheetrank (most relevant results based on the Sheet Rank algorithm), dateCreated (for sheet results returned chronologically), views (for sheet results based on popularity).

ADD STRING
sort_method
string
How to sort results. If sort, the values are sorted according to sort_fields. If score, the value in sort_fields is multiplied with the default ElasticSearch score.

sort_reverse
boolean
Whether or not to reverse the sort applied on sort_fields

sort_score_missing
double
The number used in case there is a value missing in your sort_field
source_proj
boolean
By default, the ElasticSearch document is not returned. Specifying true will return the entire document. Specifying a str or list(str) will perform a projection on the document for the specified fields

type
string
The ElasticSearch index you want to query, and the results you expect to get back. sheet returns results from Sefaria's user generated source sheets, while text returns results from the library.
